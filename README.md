Biosys_py

This script takes otu tables generated by the EA diatom pipeline; sample metadata; and sample extraction plates to create the correct import format for biosys.

conda.txt was generated using ```conda list --explicit > conda.txt```

To make the conda environment use:

```conda create --name <env> --file conda.txt```

It is reccomended to perfrom the Baroni–Urbani–Buser coefficient similarity checks with only 1 run at a time.

current issues:
    *Multicore processing not supported.
    *Baroni-Urbani-Buser similarity not at 100% functional due to:
        **Unsure if it is relevant to calculate SD of BUB coefficient.
        **Takes too long to perform for entire dataset. -solved?
        **Cut off for distance not determined.
        **Similarity doesnt take into account repeat samples.
